## Exercise Documentation

### Exercise 1: Setting Up Git
**Process:**
- Installed Git and configured user credentials
- Set up global username and email for commit attribution

**Commands Used:**
```bash
git init
git config user.name "John Doe"
git config user.email "john.doe@example.com"
```

**Lessons Learned:**
- Git configuration is essential for proper commit attribution
- Local repository initialization creates .git directory structure

### Exercise 2: Git Commits
**Process:**
- Created hello.sh with progressive improvements
- Demonstrated staging and committing workflow
- Built commit history showing project evolution

**Commands Used:**
```bash
git add hello.sh
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git commit -m "Add shebang and parameter support"
git commit -m "Add default parameter and comment"
```

**File Evolution:**
1. `echo "Hello, World"`
2. `#!/bin/bash\necho "Hello, $1"`
3. `#!/bin/bash\n# Default is "World"\nname=${1:-"World"}\necho "Hello, $name"`

**Lessons Learned:**
- Staging area allows selective commit preparation
- Commit messages should be descriptive and meaningful
- Working tree should be clean after commits

### Exercise 3: History
**Process:**
- Explored various ways to view commit history
- Customized log output formats for different needs
- Filtered commits by time and format

**Commands Used:**
```bash
git log                                    # Full history
git log --oneline                         # Compact one-line format
git log --pretty=format:'* %h %ad | %s%d [%an]' --graph --date=short -2
git log --since='5 minutes ago'           # Time-filtered history
```

**Lessons Learned:**
- Git log has powerful formatting and filtering options
- Custom formats help focus on relevant information
- Graph view shows branch relationships clearly

### Exercise 4: Check it out
**Process:**
- Navigated through commit history using checkout
- Restored different snapshots of the project
- Returned to latest version without using commit hashes

**Commands Used:**
```bash
git checkout HEAD~2    # First snapshot
git checkout HEAD~1    # Second snapshot  
git checkout main      # Latest version
```

**Lessons Learned:**
- HEAD~n notation provides relative commit navigation
- Checkout allows time travel through project history
- Branch names provide stable references to latest commits

### Exercise 5: TAG me
**Process:**
- Created tags for version management
- Tagged current and previous versions
- Navigated between tagged versions

**Commands Used:**
```bash
git tag v1              # Tag current version
git tag v1-beta HEAD~1  # Tag previous version
git checkout v1         # Navigate to tagged version
git tag                 # List all tags
```

**Lessons Learned:**
- Tags provide stable references to important commits
- Tags are useful for release management
- Tags can reference any commit, not just HEAD

### Exercise 6: Changed your mind?
**Process:**
- Demonstrated various ways to undo changes
- Reverted unwanted commits and cleaned history
- Used reset to remove commits after specific tag
- Amended commits to update without creating new ones

**Commands Used:**
```bash
git reset --hard v1     # Reset to specific tag
git commit --amend      # Modify last commit
git tag oops           # Tag unwanted commit before removal
```

**Challenges Faced:**
- Understanding difference between reset modes
- Preserving important changes while removing unwanted ones

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Used tags to mark commits before destructive operations
- Used --amend to update commits without creating duplicates

**Lessons Learned:**
- Git provides multiple ways to undo changes
- Reset --hard permanently removes uncommitted changes
- Amend allows updating the most recent commit

### Exercise 7: Move it
**Process:**
- Moved files using Git commands to preserve history
- Created Makefile for build automation
- Organized project structure with lib directory

**Commands Used:**
```bash
git mv hello.sh lib/hello.sh
git add Makefile
git commit -m "Move hello.sh to lib directory and add Makefile"
```

**Lessons Learned:**
- git mv preserves file history across moves
- Proper project organization improves maintainability
- Makefiles provide consistent build processes

### Exercise 8: Blobs, trees and commits
**Process:**
- Explored .git directory structure and contents
- Examined Git object model (blobs, trees, commits)
- Used low-level commands to inspect repository internals

**Commands Used:**
```bash
find .git/objects -type f     # Find object files
git cat-file -t <hash>        # Show object type
git cat-file -p <hash>        # Show object content
git ls-tree HEAD              # Show tree structure
```

**Git Directory Structure:**
- `.git/objects/` - Contains all Git objects (blobs, trees, commits)
- `.git/config` - Repository configuration
- `.git/refs/` - References (branches, tags)
- `.git/HEAD` - Current branch pointer

**Lessons Learned:**
- Git stores everything as objects with SHA-1 hashes
- Trees represent directory structures
- Commits link trees with metadata and parent references
- Understanding internals helps debug complex Git issues

### Exercise 9: Branching
**Process:**
- Created greet branch for new feature development
- Developed modular greeter functionality
- Maintained parallel development on main and greet branches
- Updated project documentation

**Commands Used:**
```bash
git checkout -b greet         # Create and switch to branch
git add lib/greeter.sh
git commit -m "Add greeter function"
git checkout main
git diff main greet           # Compare branches
```

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `lib/greeter.sh` - Modular greeter function
- Updated `lib/hello.sh` - Uses greeter module
- Updated `Makefile` - Reflects new structure
- `README.md` - Project documentation

**Lessons Learned:**
- Branches enable parallel feature development
- Modular code design improves maintainability
- Branch comparison helps understand differences

### Exercise 10: Conflicts, merging and rebasing
**Process:**
- Merged main into greet branch
- Created conflicting changes on main branch
- Resolved merge conflicts manually
- Demonstrated rebasing vs merging differences
- Completed fast-forward merge

**Commands Used:**
```bash
git merge main                    # Merge main into greet
git merge main                    # Create conflict
git checkout --theirs lib/hello.sh  # Resolve conflict
git add lib/hello.sh
git commit -m "Resolve conflict"
git rebase main                   # Rebase greet on main
git merge greet                   # Fast-forward merge
```

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Identified conflicting files
- Chose appropriate resolution strategy
- Staged resolved files and committed

**Lessons Learned:**
- Merge conflicts occur when same lines are modified differently
- Manual resolution requires understanding both changes
- Rebasing creates linear history, merging preserves branch structure
- Fast-forward merges occur when target branch hasn't diverged

### Exercise 11: Local and remote repositories
**Process:**
- Cloned repository to simulate remote collaboration
- Demonstrated fetch, merge, and push operations
- Updated original repository and synchronized changes
- Set up branch tracking for remote branches

**Commands Used:**
```bash
git clone hello cloned_hello      # Clone repository
git remote -v                     # Show remote information
git branch -a                     # Show all branches
git fetch origin                  # Fetch remote changes
git merge origin/main             # Merge remote changes
git push origin main greet        # Push branches to remote
```

**Remote Operations:**
- Cloning creates local copy with remote tracking
- Fetch downloads remote changes without merging
- Push uploads local changes to remote repository
- Remote branches track upstream changes

**Lessons Learned:**
- Remote repositories enable collaboration
- Fetch + merge = pull operation
- Branch tracking simplifies remote synchronization
- Remote names (origin) provide convenient references

### Exercise 12: Bare repositories
**Process:**
- Created bare repository for sharing between multiple developers
- Configured bare repository as shared remote
- Demonstrated push/pull workflow with shared repository
- Updated documentation to reflect shared development

**Commands Used:**
```bash
git clone --bare hello hello.git    # Create bare repository
git remote add shared ../hello.git  # Add bare repo as remote
git push shared main greet          # Push to shared repository
git fetch shared                    # Fetch from shared repository
git merge shared/main               # Merge shared changes
```

**Bare Repository Characteristics:**
- No working directory - only Git data
- Designed for sharing between multiple repositories
- Prevents conflicts from direct commits
- Central point for collaboration

**Lessons Learned:**
- Bare repositories are essential for team collaboration
- They serve as central sharing points without working directories
- Multiple developers can push/pull safely to/from bare repositories
- Bare repos prevent the confusion of pushing to checked-out branches

### Key Questions and Answers

**Q: What is the purpose of .git/ subdirectories?**
A: 
- `.git/objects/` - Stores all Git objects (blobs, trees, commits)
- `.git/config` - Repository-specific configuration
- `.git/refs/` - References to branches and tags
- `.git/HEAD` - Points to current branch

**Q: What's the difference between merging and rebasing?**
A: 
- Merging preserves branch history and creates merge commits
- Rebasing creates linear history by replaying commits on target branch
- Merging is safer for shared branches, rebasing creates cleaner history

**Q: What's the single git command equivalent to fetch + merge?**
A: `git pull` - fetches changes from remote and merges them into current branch

**Q: What are bare repositories and why are they needed?**
A: Bare repositories contain only Git data without working directory. They're needed for:
- Central sharing point for multiple developers
- Preventing conflicts from pushing to checked-out branches
- Server-side repositories that only store Git history
